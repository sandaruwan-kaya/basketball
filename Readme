# Basketball Shooting Analysis App

A Streamlit-based web application that analyzes basketball shooting technique and counts shots using Google's Gemini AI models. Upload a video of a player shooting, and get detailed feedback on form, shot counts, and coaching tips.

## Features

- **Shot Detection**: Automatically detects and counts shot attempts and makes from uploaded videos.
- **Technique Analysis**: Provides structured coaching feedback on stance, footwork, release, and more.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares results from Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3 Pro Preview models.
- **Real-time Logging**: Logs analysis progress and results to the terminal.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple Streamlit interface for uploading videos and viewing results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (set in `.env` file)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandaruwan-kaya/basketball.git
   cd basketball

   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
